# Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

# The way to do this is with DP.

# Construct a table of width m where m is the number of coins and n where n is the amount. We assume that the smallest denomination is 1 so the maximum number of coins that can make up the amount is m anyway.
