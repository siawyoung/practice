# Practice

This repository serves as a collection of practice problems for technical software interviews.

There is a good mix of easier and harder problems from all of the topics that you are expected to be familiar with. The problems in here are purposely unlabelled - there is no indication as to which "topic" or "data structures" are involved, or how easy or difficult a problem is. I believe this provides a closer experience to an actual interview.

Programming interview books are usually indexed by topic, and the questions are found after each topic. Platforms like Hacker Rank explicitly indicate the topic as well as the difficulty of each question. These indications are mental crutches and will not prompt a full exploration of the problem and the thought process to approaching algorithmic problems.

## Going forward

**TODO**: I also plan to write more about other things:

- Python-specific things to note, e.g. differences between 2 and 3, which is useful when using coding platforms that only support Python 2, which libraries are useful, etc.

## Caveats

There are **ABSOLUTELY** no guarantees as to the correctness of the solutions. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if some of them were wrong. If you do find any mistakes, please submit a pull request with a counter example and the proposed changes. Thank you!

##Languages used  
C++14 was used to solve some of the questions. All .cpp code snippets can be compiled and tested from the command line using: 
`g++ -o executable_name filename.cpp` <br> 
`./executable_name`
